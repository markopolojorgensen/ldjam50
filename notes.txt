Party on! Do you have what it takes to keep the party going and make it to that giant disco in the sky? Find out in this time-pressure platformer! This is my submission for the 'Extra' category of ludum dare 50.

controls
wasd/arrow keys to move
x to attack
z to interact / talk
controllers should work too.
keyboard key notes: those names are for qwerty, it should still be the bottom left two buttons even on non-qwerty keyboards. I don't have a non-qwerty keyboard to test with, so let me know if it works or doesn't work for you!



TODO
  hud: z to interact
