  do npcs do anything?
    yeah, they give you advice & tell you about secrets
  npcs move to every room you visit, assuming you've bought their item
    otherwise, they stay where they started?

      "It's just a game, don't lose your head."
      "Don't you dare try pulling a rabbit out of me!"
      "I don't like boats. Too scared of cap sizing."

      "Thanks for throwing the party, it's been fun to unwind."
      "People say I'm all wrapped up in myself, but they just don't see past my outer layers."
      "You might think I like wrap music, but I'm more into future bass."
      "This is really turning out to be a long party; better wrap it up before my wife gets home."



  get_world() -> things need to spawn stuff in the room, since that's what gets unloaded

  music slows down as the countdown approaches zero?

  tutorial
    this is you
      wasd / arrow keys to move
    you love throwing parties
      x or q activates things you are next to
    x or q also attacks
      things can be attacked
    "this party won't last very long without more merrymakers, I had better invite some people!"

  giant disco in the sky platforms appear based on purchases?
  takes forever to get up to disco in the sky so you have to have gotten all the time upgrades?

    punch bowl that sells multi-jump
